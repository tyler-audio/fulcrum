# Fulcrum
Fulcrum is a loop-based musical step sequencer inspired by existing software and hardware units. Users are able to choose from a selection of various samples and program patterns that will then trigger the selected sounds in time. Each sound has various channel controls that can be used to perform a rough mix on the music. Tonal samples open a interactive piano roll when selected, which allow users to play those samples as an instrument.
This project was completed during my experience in Hack Reactor as a part of a two-day MVP sprint.
